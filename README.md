One of the things that give me the most pride is that all the programming languages I know are self-taught. Anyone or any institution hasn't taught me them.

While I am proficient in English, speak well in Urdu, and can understand a bit of Chinese, by multilingual, I am referring to proficiency in multiple programming languages.

```cs
Console.WriteLine("I have multiple Unity projects, standalone applications. Currently writing a real-life economy simulation system in C#.");
Console.WriteLine("I have written a deep neural network in C# using ML.NET.");
```
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/PHP-logo.svg" alt="PHP" width="50"/>

```php
echo("Despite what the language is SUPPOSED to be used for, I've used it to work on game servers for the famous block-game, Minecraft.");
echo("Since NetherGames uses PocketMine, a Minecraft server software written in PHP, most of my work supporting the development and developing extra features has been done in PHP.");
echo("PS: libReplay, a high-level game-replay recording & playback framework for NetherGames, is written in PHP.");
```
![Python](python.png)
```py
print("I have worked with Tensorflow in Python.")
print("Furthermore, I have done multiple data crunching using Python to convert raw data into useable data for artificial intelligence models written in both Python and C#.")
```

### Other languages that I know, but haven't done anything significant in... yet:
